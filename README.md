The goal is to understand how prices have changed over time, compare growth rate of metros, investigate causes and highlight which metro has the most investment stability.

## Project Contents

- "analysis_notebook.ipynb" -  Main Jupytr notebook including data analysis and visualizations
- "images/" - Folder containing graphs generated by the analysis
- "hpi_master.csv" - CSV dataset used for analysis
- "README.md" - This file is used to describe the project 
- "report.md" - This file is used to report insights from the HPI analysis conducted within this project

## How to run

1. Make sure all files (analysis_notebook.ipynb, hpi_master.csv, images/) are in the same folder
2. Open the notebook (.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or VS code 
3. Run the notebook cells in order to reproduce all graphs and calculations 
4. Graphs will automatically save to the images folder

## Notes 

- Make sure Python packages like pandas, maplotlib, and numpy are installed
- The analysis uses seasonally adjusted HPI (index_sa) and averages data by metro area
