    Based on the images shown within the graphs, Austin has shown tremendous growth from the 90's up until recently after 2022.  
We can also see that the Dallas and Houston metro areas have shown little growth over time. It is also worth noting that each metro areas have consistent increases and decreases based on the graphs which is likely from inflation and deflation. Within this essay I will explain why these metro areas have the current housing price index they do and some recommendations to increase the value of homes in these metro areas to overall create a better situation for most. 
    To begin with Austin, major growth sparked after a technological boom in Austin that began in the 1990's with the creation of Dell 
in Austin, with the first creation of a dell computer being at University of Texas in Austin, and IBM's software development lab which was created in 1992. This would set the precedence for a huge continuation of major tech industries such as Google, Apple, to establish their presence and allow bring in tens of tens of thousands of employees in the 2000's to the 2010's. This trend has continued to be the case in the 2020's with more huge tech industries like Tesla and the expansions of the ones that have been there for a while. However, a huge problem of housing price inflation and lack of availability in reaction to increased residents arises. This is exactly what has happened with Austin, and it is pointed to as a land use regulation issue. This is currently being reversed by density bonuses which incentivize units for affordability in ways such as extra parking lot space. 
    With the current state of Austin and its development, there has been a proposed idea to include programs, subsidies, and regulations 
all in alignment. This is a great idea in order to keep the house price index at steady growth and efficiently regulate housing affordability and availability. However, it is important to make sure that the pace of this idea and regulations put in place by Austin matches the demand of housing and growth of the Austin Market or else there may be a terrible reverse effect. It is hard to see how the Austin metro area HPI will continue to grow, but hopefully with how things have recently changed it will be in a positive manner.   
    For Houston, a very strong cause that is attributed to the real estate market is the city's strong ties to the energy industry.   
This market shows constant fluctuation due to changes in oil prices, which ultimately affects housing prices based on employment. As a result, this ultimately leads to a reduction in house pricing due to surplus of housing inventory from increased house sales because of economic pressures. Another major issue that affects the Houston metro area housing price index is the rise in crime rates within Houston. In 2024, nearly 19 of 30 neighborhood areas in Harris County reported crimes to be the "biggest problem" within the county. It is also important to note that both of these factors have taken place in sync with a nearly doubled median home sale price from 2011 to 2022. The best solution to prevent this common problem is to invest more into criminal justice within Harris county while also adjusting housing prices according to the energy industry. It would also be very helpful to try and slow down and maybe even slightly reverse the trend of growth rates of house pricing temporarily in order to drive the economy and allow housing to increase smoothly like the Austin metro area.
    Finally, for the Dallas metro area, there is a huge problem of an affordable housing shortage. It is estimated that only 14 affordable 
and available rental homes exist for every 100 extremely low-income households in Dallas. There is also an issue of luxury homes being built in response to the growth of the Dallas population which has only worsened the problem of housing affordability and overpopulation of Dallas resulting in the constant fluctuation of the housing price index. A good strategy to help reduce this would be temporary government subsidies for real estate to temporarily lower prices to match affordability until there is a good enough amount of the population housed to better control the population and match the robust Dallas job market growth. 
    To conclude, it is evident that these metros have shown major growth overtime, but there are still huge factors holding them back. Though  
this is not the exact solution to fix every problem with these major metros; these suggestions would likely help increase housing price index for these metros in a linear manner for a good period of time. However, it is very hard to say what will happen for sure because of constant changes in the economy affected by many factors. Hopefully we will see major growth in real estate for these metros within the next few years with the proper decision making of the government and real estate companies.
